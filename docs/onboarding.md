# Project Onboarding Documentation

## Introduction

### Project Description

Welcome to the Anywork Collab Onboarding Documentation. This software is designed to fill the gap between consumer's digital experience and business's efficient operation. It aims to fulfill busienss and consumer's needs, providing users with platform and business tools.

### Motivation

The motivation behind Anywork Collab stems from the need to help business develops digital presence as well as team organization. By addressing poorly develop digital presence and inefficient team operation, we aim to grow business from the root cause by treat them as our partners. This project was inspired by the tight competition business has faced, and it strives to [describe the overarching vision or mission].

### Development Methods

We adopt Design Driven Development (DDD) to ensure that every aspect of our project aligns with the overall vision and design principles. DDD helps us maintain a user-centric approach, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users.

### System Architecture Overview

Anywork Collab serves continuous development by using plugin based application where specific business logics are abstracted from the details of the system. Applying design pattern principles, we choose microservice approach to solve the complexity of various integration. This works by defining general interface on each program either it's frontend or backend. This effectively deploys innovation without interrupting business operational.

### Tech Stack

Our project leverages a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. Below is an overview of the technologies we use:

- **Frontend**:
  - [Framework/Library] (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
  - [Styling] (e.g., Sass, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap)

- **Backend**:
  - [Backend Language/Framework] (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails)
  - RESTful API
  - [Database] (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)

- **DevOps**:
  - Docker, Kubernetes
  - CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Travis CI)
  - Monitoring and Logging (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)

- **Version Control**:
  - Git, GitHub/GitLab

### Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is designed to support a robust and scalable environment for development, testing, and production. Here is an overview of our infrastructure setup:

- **Hosting**:
  - Cloud Provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
  - Managed services for databases, storage, and compute resources

- **Containerization**:
  - Docker for containerization of applications
  - Kubernetes for container orchestration

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying code
  - Integration with version control for seamless code updates

- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Real-time monitoring of applications and infrastructure
  - Centralized logging for troubleshooting and performance analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed
